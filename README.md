#My Data Analysis Capstone (Topic: Music)

## 1) What is this project about?
 - I am a student practicing data analysis. I chose a topic I like: my music listening habits (or a similar dataset). The idea is to look at data on songs, artists, and playback times to understand what I listen to most, when I listen, and if there are any unusual or interesting patterns. I'm not looking to do something super professional. I just want to practice, learn, and have fun with real data.

## 2) Problem
 - I feel like I always listen to the same things, and I'm not sure if that's true. Question: What do I listen to the most, and how does my listening change depending on the day, time... or maybe mood¿

## 3) Objectives
 - Top 10 most listened (or most present) artists and songs in the dataset.
 - Time-based patterns: see what time of day and day of the week I listen to music most.
 - Discover variety: measure if I repeat the same things a lot (simple variety index).
 - (Optional) Basic recommendation: list 5 - 10 "new" songs?artists similar to what I already listen to.
 - Scope: Keep it simple, with clear charts and few formulas.+

## 4) Analysis Questions
- What are my most frequent artists and songs?
- Do I listen more in the morning, afternoon, or evening? Does it change between weekdays and weekends?
- How much variety is there? (Always the same artists, or is there rotation?)
- What genres are most common? Are popular songs shorter or longer?

## 5) Data
- My exported listening history from Spotify in CSV format

## 6) What I'm going to do (mini plan)
- Load the data and review the columns.
- Clean: Handle dates, nulls, duplicated, and ensure correct data typers (number, text, date).
- EDA:
  * Top artits/songs
  * Charts by hour/day.
  * Average song duration.
  * Simple variety metric (e.g The percentage of plays from the top 10).
- Results: a couple of charts and brief conclusions.
- (Optional) Simple recommendatios: "if you like X, try Y"

## 7) Easty metrics
- **Top-N share:** Percentage of plays from the Top 10 artists.
- **Sessions by time slot:** Count by morning/afternoon/night.
- **Variety:** Number of unique artists/total plays.
- **Average song duration**
